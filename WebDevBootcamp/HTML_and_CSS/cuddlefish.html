    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <hr />
    <p id="one">
      Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are marine molluscs of the family Sepiidae. They
      belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes squid, octopuses, and
      nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell, the cuttlebone, which
      is used for control of buoyancy. Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils,
      eight arms, and two tentacles furnished with denticulated suckers, with
      which they secure their prey. They generally range in size from 15 to 25
      cm (6 to 10 in), with the largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia
      apama), reaching 50 cm (20 in) in mantle length and over 10.5 kg (23 lb)
      in mass.[3] Cuttlefish eat small molluscs, crabs, shrimp, fish, octopuses,
      worms, and other cuttlefish. Their predators include dolphins, larger fish
      (including sharks), seals, seabirds, and other cuttlefish. The typical
      life expectancy of a cuttlefish is about 1â€“2 years. Studies are said to
      indicate cuttlefish to be among the most intelligent invertebrates.[4]
      Cuttlefish also have one of the largest brain-to-body size ratios of all
      invertebrates.[4] The Greco-Roman world valued the cuttlefish as a source
      of the unique brown pigment the creature releases from its siphon when it
      is alarmed. The word for the cuttlefish in both Greek and Latin,

      The characteristic W-shape of the cuttlefish eye Pupil expansion in Sepia
      officinalis Cuttlefish, like other cephalopods, have sophisticated eyes.
      The organogenesis and the final structure of the cephalopod eye
      fundamentally differ from those of vertebrates, such as humans.[18]
      Superficial similarities between cephalopod and vertebrate eyes are
      thought to be examples of convergent evolution. The cuttlefish pupil is a
      smoothly curving W-shape.[19][20] Although cuttlefish cannot see
      color,[21] they can perceive the polarization of light, which enhances
      their perception of contrast. They have two spots of concentrated sensor
      cells on their retinas (known as foveae), one to look more forward, and
      one to look more backward. The eye changes focus by shifting the position
      of the entire lens with respect to the retina, instead of reshaping the
      lens as in mammals. Unlike the vertebrate eye, no blind spot exists,
      because the optic nerve is positioned behind the retina. They are capable
      of using stereopsis, enabling them to discern depth/distance because their
      brain calculates the input from both eyes.[22][23] The cuttlefish's eyes
      are thought to be fully developed before birth, and they start observing
      their surroundings while still in the egg. In consequence, they may prefer
      to hunt the prey they saw before hatching.[24]

    <h2>Range and habitat</h2>

      Video of a cuttlefish in its natural habitat The family Sepiidae, which
      contains all cuttlefish, inhabits tropical and temperate ocean waters.
      They are mostly shallow-water animals, although they are known to go to
      depths of about 600 m (2,000 ft).[70] They have an unusual biogeographic
      pattern; they are present along the coasts of East and South Asia, Western
      Europe, and the Mediterranean, as well as all coasts of Africa and
      Australia, but are totally absent from the Americas. By the time the
      family evolved, ostensibly in the Old World, the North Atlantic possibly
      had become too cold and deep for these warm-water species to cross.[71]
      The common cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis), is found in the Mediterranean,
      North and Baltic seas, although populations may occur as far south as
      South Africa. They are found in sublittoral depths, between the low tide
      line and the edge of the continental shelf, to about 180 m (600 ft).[72]
      The cuttlefish is listed under the Red List category of "least concern" by
      the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. This means that while some
      over-exploitation of the marine animal has occurred in some regions due to
      large-scale commercial fishing, their wide geographic range prevents them
      from being too threatened. Ocean acidification, however, caused largely by
      higher levels of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere, is cited as a
      potential threat.[73] Some studies suggest that ocean acidification does
      not impair normal embryonic development, survival rates or body size.
